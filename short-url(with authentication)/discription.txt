                      ----DESIGN A URL SHORTNER -----

design a url shortner service that takes in valid URL and returns a shortnerer URL redirecting the user to the previously provided URl .

Also , keep track of total visits/clicks on the URL. 

ROUTES

POST /URL : Generate a new short Url and returns the shortened URL in the format example.com/random-id 

GET/:id - Redirects the user to the original url .

GET/URL/analytics/:id - Returns the click for the provided  short id .



          -----EJS------

At first we have to set which view engine we are using so 
app.set("view engine ","ejs") --> since we are using the ejs as a view engine so i am setting the ejs as a view engine
